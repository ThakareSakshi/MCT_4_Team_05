Explanation:
I've created a web page that features a simple payment processing application. Here's a summary of what my code does:

HTML Code:

1.I've defined the basic structure of my webpage, including metadata, title, external CSS styles, and JavaScript scripts.
2.There's a container that holds the content, and it's styled with CSS to have rounded corners and a background image.
3."payment" section contains a navigation bar, a form for payment input, a loader for simulating payment processing, and a result section for displaying payment status.

CSS Code:

1.I've defined styles for the entire page, setting background images and fonts.
2.I've styled various elements, such as buttons, containers, and input fields.
3.I've applied styles to elements for responsiveness, including different styles for smaller screens.

JavaScript Code:

1.I've defined variables to access various HTML elements in my page, such as buttons and form inputs.
2.I have a function called paymentProcess that simulates a payment process:
3.It hides the form and navigation, shows a loader.
4.After a random delay, if else condition deside payment successful or failed.
5.it updates the result section with a success or failure message and details.
6.I've added event listeners:
7.The form submits trigger a payment process based on the input values.
